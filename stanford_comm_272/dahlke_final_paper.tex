\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Financial markets were recently upended by massive short squeezes of a
cadre of stocks including GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings,
BlackBerry, and Nokia. The recent events saw historic fluctuations in
the prices of these stocks. Individual investors made tens-of-millions
of dollars, often with leveraged positions. What is particularly unique
about these events is that they were triggered by retail investors.
These retail investors, bolstered by financial stimuli and an abundance
of free time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, organized collective behavior
actions on an internet forum, the Reddit subforum r/WallStreetBets.

Media commentators quickly offered various perspectives on the events.
Is this class warfare? A populist movement? Just some bored, lonely
young men trying to make money? There is a deep pool of academic
literature that explores the psychological motivations of retail
investors and personal finance more broadly. For example,
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. In addition, there is a small, yet robust and
powerful set of research on the impacts of media on financial markets.
However, I am interest in the media psychology component of financial
decisions. I am interested in how media impact financial markets
in-so-much-as how the media effects, and is driven by, individual
investors.

More broadly, my research investigates how individuals enter and
participate in complex systems. In this case, the totality of the
financial markets are beyond comprehension. Investors, particularly
small, retail traders, are unlikely to ever fully understand the complex
system of global finance. Yet, they do. And as is increasingly common,
participants are coordinating activity in order to alter the systems
that they participate in. As it pertains to retail investors, I
ultimately want to know both \emph{why} they participate in the markets,
and more importantly, \emph{how} they participate in the financial
markets. What is the media ecology that individual investors are exposed
to or seek out? How do novice traders come to trust the financial
investment advice of various media outlets, communities, or individuals?
What do people do after they lose their life savings in GameStop stock?
How much time do retail investors devote to trading financial
securities?

\hypertarget{covid-19-and-retail-traders}{%
\subsection{COVID-19 and Retail
Traders}\label{covid-19-and-retail-traders}}

The COVID-19 global pandemic has spurred a rise in retail investors that
rivals the boom of retail investors during the internet bubble after the
rise of discount stock brokerages. At the center of the rise in retail
investors is Robinhood. Robinhood is a smart phone app and stock trading
platform that offers free trading of stocks and other securities. While
other trading platforms have since adopted free trading, Robinhood
created and maintained a significant following by being the first to
offer free trading, it's gamified user interface, and a target
demographic of young, new investors. With Robinhood easing barriers of
entry for new investors, financial stimuli from the government due to
the pandemic, and newly-found swathes of free-time, these retail
investors grew in size and influence during the pandemic.

Retail investors now routinely account for 20\% of stock market activity
(Pagano et al. 2021) These retail investors on Robinhood significantly
impact financial markets, particularly during COVID (Pagano, Sedunov,
and Velthuis 2020). Users of Robinhood increased the amount of money
they invested on the platform during the pandemic (Welch 2020).
Robinhood traders primarily engage in both momentum and contrarian
strategies where they invest in stocks that have already demonstrated
rising price momentum and ``buying the dip'' where they buy stocks that
have recently fallen in price, respectively (Pagano, Sedunov, and
Velthuis 2020). In other words, Robinhood investors did not panic during
broad market turmoil during COVID-19 and often used price drops as
buying opportunities. However, in aggregate they do not produce an
alpha, or ``beat the market'' by producing larger-than-average returns
(Pagano et al. 2021). Their trades ultimately mostly produce noise in
financial markets (Pagano et al. 2021). If all Robinhood investors do is
create ``noise'' in the markets, then the noisiest they've been is when
GameStop stock rose dramatically in early 2021.

\hypertarget{gamestop}{%
\subsection{GameStop}\label{gamestop}}

In January and February 2021, a handful of stocks experienced an extreme
``short-squeeze'' which effectively sky-rocketed the prices of these
stocks that was caused by decentralized retail investors acting in
concert (Lyócsa, Baumöhl, and Vŷrost 2021). The largest movement was
seen in GameStop which took most of the attention of the saga. Many
investors, both individual and institutional, gained and lost
significant sums of money. For a full recapping of the sequence of
events, I recommend \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

The GameStop saga provides support for the principle that market forces
tend to make markets fair, ``where fairness is defined as investors
`getting what they pay for' rather than investors `beating the
market'\,'' due to the apparent misvaluation of GameStop and other
stocks by institutional investors (Macey 2021). On the other hand, the
events also cast doubt as to whether the SEC is achieving its stated
goal of maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets" (Macey 2021).

The retail investors who caused the short squeeze organized on a
subforum of the popular website of Reddit called ``Wall Street Bets,''
or r/wallstreetbets (Lyócsa, Baumöhl, and Vŷrost 2021). As a result, the
GameStop saga is seen as battle between Wall Street and small, Robinhood
traders who are upset at Wall Street. The members of r/wallstreetbets
maintained a sense of unity and purpose throughout the events (Muzio
2021). Regardless of whether the organized behavior of r/wallstreetbets
users is a political movement, hopeful acts of ``sticking it to
hedgefunds'' or something else, they have demonstrated their power to
move financial markets (Muzio 2021). However, retail investors as whole
both bought and ``shorted''--or bet that GameStop stock was going to go
down--indicating that ``the Gamestop frenzy was not a pure digital
protest against Wall Street but speculative trading by a group of retail
investors, in line with their prior high-risk trading behavior'' (Hasso
et al. 2021).

\hypertarget{rwallstreetbets}{%
\subsection{r/WallStreetBets}\label{rwallstreetbets}}

Wall Street Bets is a subreddit where investors talk about their stock
trades. The group is known for their risky ``YOLO'' (You Only Live Once)
trades (Muzio 2021). There is a particular language and meme culture
that permeates from the group and potentially helps to create their
culture of ``degeneracy'' (Boylston et al. 2021). For example, they
celebrate people with ``diamond hands'' as those who are prepared to
hold to their stocks for a long time and decry ``paper hands,'' those
who miss out on profits by selling too a stock too early (News 2020).
They maintain they are not ``dumb,'' but they are ``retarded'' or
``autists.'' Although these words are derogatory, they use it as a way
to self-deprecate and build unity.
